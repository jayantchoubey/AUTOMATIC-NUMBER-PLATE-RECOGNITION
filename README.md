# AUTOMATIC-NUMBER-PLATE-RECOGNITION
A Machine Learning project using Tensorflow and EasyOCR that identifies number plates from vehicles in real time and stores their number.

The camera records live vehicles in traffic, identify the the location of the number plate, click a photo of it and store it in a folder, then it uses easyOCR to read the number and store it in another database.
